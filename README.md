# Generative_model_project

TOPIC: Image to Text Multimodal Generative Model

1. Please install the required dependencies using the command: pip install torch torchvision transformers datasets nltk matplotlib

2. Please pay attention to comments that ask you to re-run certain cells before executing others.

3. Along with the main Jupyer Notebook file (which contains all the training and sampling code), the BART model weights when the ViT model weights were frozen and unfrozen are also uploaded in separate .pth files to this GitHub Repository. The .pth files containing the ViT model weights when they were frozen and unfrozen could not be uploaded to the GitHub Repository as the files were excessively large, so they were instead shared to the email ali.bereyhi@utoronto.ca in One Drive.

THANK YOU.
